<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>During my junior year I participated in an independent study with the School of Information. The independent study is a collaboration between the School of Information and Michigan Athletics. There are around six other students and we each work with a team at Michigan and do various analytical projects. I have worked with the hockey team and completed one project and am in progress of a second project! </p>

    <h2>Recruiting</h2>
    <p>First semester I worked with one of the coaches at Michigan to improve how the coaches approach recruiting. I collected data from all Big Ten teams from the 2018-2019 season and attempted to find a relationship between a playerâ€™s success in their pre-college league to their success in the Big Ten. In particular I looked at which leagues had the most successful players. I used python and BeautifulSoup to scrape the data and Excel to complete the statistical analysis and create visualizations.</p>
    <p>I was planning on presenting this project at the Sports Analytics Symposium in March along with sitting on a panel of analysts to discuss our work. </p>
